          A German physicist and astronomer named Karl Schwarzschild proposed
          the modern version of a black hole in 1915 after coming up with an
          exact solution to Einstein's approximations of general relativity.
          Schwarzschild realised it was possible for mass to be squeezed into an
          infinitely small point. This would make spacetime around it bend so
          that nothing – not even massless photons of light – could escape its
          curvature. The cusp of the black hole's slide into oblivion is today
          referred to as its event horizon, and the distance between this
          boundary and the infinitely dense core – or singularity – is named
          after Schwarzschild. Theoretically, all masses have a Schwarzschild
          radius that can be calculated. If the Sun's mass was squeezed into an
          infinitely small point, it would form a black hole with a radius of
          just under 3 kilometres (about 2 miles). Similarly, Earth's mass would
          have a Schwarzschild radius of just a few millimetres, making a black
          hole no bigger than a marble. For decades, black holes were exotic
          peculiarities of general relativity. Physicists have became
          increasingly confident in their existence as other extreme
          astronomical objects, such as neutron stars, were discovered. Today
          it's believed most galaxies have monstrous black holes at their core.
