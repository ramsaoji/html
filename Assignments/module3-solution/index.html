        <p>
          Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to
          the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to
          animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent
          throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat
          has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared
          in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing,
          frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose.
          Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become
          a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more
          healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and
          saturated fat.[2] The poultry farming industry that accounts for
          chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of
          the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to
          intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens
          using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations
          estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them
          outnumber humans more than two to one.

        <p>
          Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal
          muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef
          is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2] Most beef
          skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain
          parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin
          steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
          while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings,
          on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner
          (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.
          The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts
          that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail,
          liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly
          the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the
          brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform
          encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the
          kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United
          States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters).
          Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often
          cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for
          making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.<br />

        <p>
          Sushi (寿司) is a traditional food from Japan. It is a popular dish in
          other countries as well, such as America, Canada, and the UK, along
          with many other countries. Sushi is made with specially prepared rice.
          The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi also contains
          raw or cooked seafood, and sometimes vegetables as well. Sometimes
          sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori. There are many
          different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is
          nigirizushi: fish that is placed on top of a small portion of sushi
          rice. Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of rice, such as
          egg instead of fish. Makizushi consists of rice rolled around fish
          and/or vegetables. In America, makizushi is more popular than
          nigirizushi. Another type is known as temaki or a hand roll. This kind
          of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the nori wrapped around the
          ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of rice,
          fish, and vegetables.<br />
